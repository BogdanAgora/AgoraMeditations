# Requirements Document

## Introduction

The Videos page in the Agora Meditations application is currently displaying an error message about YouTube API connection issues, despite the fact that the playlists functionality works correctly with the same API key. This indicates an inconsistency in how the YouTube API is being implemented or called between different parts of the application. This feature aims to diagnose and fix the Videos page error while ensuring consistent YouTube API usage across the platform.

## Requirements

### Requirement 1

**User Story:** As a user visiting the Agora Meditations website, I want to be able to access the Videos page without encountering API errors, so that I can browse and watch meditation videos seamlessly.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN a user clicks the "Videos" button in the header THEN the Videos page SHALL load successfully without displaying API error messages
2. WHEN the Videos page loads THEN it SHALL display a list of available meditation videos using the same YouTube API that works for playlists
3. WHEN the YouTube API key is valid and playlists are working THEN the Videos page SHALL also work with the same API configuration
4. IF there are actual API issues THEN the error message SHALL be more specific and helpful for debugging

### Requirement 2

**User Story:** As a developer maintaining the application, I want consistent YouTube API usage across all features, so that API-related bugs are easier to prevent and debug.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN implementing YouTube API calls THEN the system SHALL use a consistent pattern for API key handling across Videos and Playlists features
2. WHEN an API error occurs THEN the system SHALL log specific error details to help with debugging
3. WHEN the API key is missing or invalid THEN the system SHALL provide clear error messages distinguishing between different types of API issues
4. WHEN API quota is exceeded THEN the system SHALL handle this gracefully with appropriate user messaging

### Requirement 3

**User Story:** As a user of the application, I want reliable access to both Videos and Playlists features, so that I have a consistent experience across all content types.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN the YouTube API key is properly configured THEN both Videos and Playlists pages SHALL work consistently
2. WHEN there are temporary API issues THEN the system SHALL provide fallback behavior or cached content where possible
3. WHEN API calls fail THEN the user SHALL receive informative error messages that don't expose technical details unnecessarily
4. WHEN the application starts THEN it SHALL validate the YouTube API configuration and log any issues for developers

### Requirement 4

**User Story:** As a developer debugging API issues, I want detailed error logging and diagnostics, so that I can quickly identify and resolve YouTube API problems.

#### Acceptance Criteria

1. WHEN YouTube API calls are made THEN the system SHALL log request details and response status for debugging
2. WHEN API errors occur THEN the system SHALL log the specific error type, message, and relevant request parameters
3. WHEN comparing Videos vs Playlists API usage THEN the logging SHALL clearly show any differences in implementation
4. WHEN API quota limits are approached THEN the system SHALL log warnings before hitting the limit
